> simple React example with TypeScript

My experiment in creating a basic application with React _and_ TypeScript. Bootstrapped with `create-react-app`.  
It fetches data from the [Cocktail Db API][cocktaildb].

The project is a simple demo for learning purposes.  
I have some experience with [ReasonReact](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/reason-music-player), and I wanted to see how TypeScript compares to Reason.

If you want to learn more about React with TypeScript, check out the **[React+TypeScript Cheatsheets](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet#reacttypescript-cheatsheets)**.

## ‚ú® Demo

A live demo is deployed to **[GitHub pages](https://sophiabrandt.github.io/typescript-react-cocktails/)**.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm run dev
```

The command will run the Typescript compiler, which watches for changes in `.tsx` files, and the `react-scripts start` script for the React development server.

## Run tests

(This repo doesn't have tests.)

```sh
npm run test
```
